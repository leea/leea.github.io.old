I recently read this book on a trip through Peru. I found it enjoyable and thought provoking.

Pi Patel, an Indian son of a zoo keeper, gets shipwrecked and is forced to survive as a castaway at sea.  Through the course of the story, survival, religious beliefs, and the taming of wild animals are touched. 

The book has some ingredients for a popular hit (which it is). The survival story is bloody and gruesome. The information about zoology are interesting and entertaining. And the major point it makes about religious beliefs resonates with the faithful, and non-believers. Overall it was an enjoyable read, the story is gripping and fascinating enough to pull you in and the deeper message leaves the reader thinking after the book is finished.
